          <p>At the start of quarantine, I chose to go home to the Bay Area to be with my family and take proper safety precautions. My brother who is a sophomore at Santa Clara also came back home and it was nice to have my whole family together during this unpredictable time.</p>

          <h3 class="cardH1">Boulder, Colorado</h3>
          <p>The Bay Area at the beginning of March was a pretty big hot spot. My mom has asthma and was afraid of being staying in San Mateo. We decided to pack up and go to our mountain house in Boulder, since cases were low and it would be a nice change of scenery.</p>

          <p>After quarantining for almost two months in Boulder, my parents felt strongly that I should return back to SLO to wrap up the last month with my best friends. I just got back this weekend, and I have had a smile on my face the whole time being back in my favorite little town.</p>
